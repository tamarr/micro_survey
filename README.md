# README

Welcome to your new backend server generated by [frever.me](frever.me) !

Frever generates a full ruby on rails application with a postgresql database that can be deployed, as is, to Heroku or Digital Ocean. You do not need to install anything locally, you can deploy this folder to github directly and follow the How to Deploy steps.

## How to Deploy
**Important note!** The app does not have a root. You will find the basic views on `app_location`/`plural_of_your_model`. For example if you created a model called survey, basic views will be `app_location`/surveys

1. First add the folder to git and create a Github repository. Note: the folder must be the root of the repository

### [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

2. Create a Heroku account and click **New -> Create new app**
3. Name your app and select region and click **create app**
4. Under "Deployment method" select **Github**
5. Connect your repository
6. Under "Manual deploy" click **deploy now**
7. Once deploy is done, you can find your `app_location` under **Settings -> Domains**
8. Tip: enable auto deploys so every push to the main branch will deploy the new version: **Deploy -> Enable Automatic Deploys**
9. Tip: After trying out your solution upgrade to **hobby** to avoid database sleep and long response times when servicing customers

### [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

2. Create a Digital Ocean account and click **Create -> Apps**
3. Choose your github repository (you will need to give permissions)
4. Verify branch and click **Next**
5. Click **add Database** and select a **PostgresSql db**
6. Name your app and select region and click **Next**
7. Select plan and container and click **Launch Basic App**
8. Wait for deploy to finish...
9. Go to **Components -> db -> Connection Details** and select **Connection String**
10. Copy the connection string
11. Go to **Settings -> App-Level Environment Variables** and click **Edit**
12. Set key to **DATABASE_URL** and the value copied on step 10 and **Save**
13. Wait for deploy to finish...
14. Go to **Console** and type `rake db:migrate`
15. Your app location should be at the top
